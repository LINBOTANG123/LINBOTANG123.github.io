## Spatial-Temporal Change Detection, UW-Madison
- Developing a contrastive representation learning model for anomaly detection, focusing on detecting and categorizing house, road, and farm damage caused by natural disasters
- Training on the modified xBD dataset and improving the accuracy of self-supervised change detection model STRCLR by modifying the model to accomplish the anomaly detection downstream task
